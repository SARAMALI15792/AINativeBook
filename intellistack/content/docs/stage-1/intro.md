# Stage 1: Foundations

<div className="stage-badge stage-1">Stage 1</div>

Welcome to Stage 1 of the IntelliStack learning path! This stage covers the foundational knowledge needed for Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

## Learning Objectives

<div className="learning-objectives">

By the end of this stage, you will be able to:

- Master Python programming fundamentals for robotics applications
- Navigate and manage Linux/Ubuntu systems confidently
- Apply essential mathematics (linear algebra, calculus, probability) to robotics problems
- Understand basic physics concepts relevant to robotics

</div>

## Prerequisites

<div className="prerequisites">

**Before starting Stage 1, you should have:**

- Basic computer literacy
- Motivation to learn robotics and AI
- Access to a computer (Linux/Ubuntu recommended, or Windows with WSL2)

</div>

## Topics Covered

1. **Python Programming**
   - Variables, data types, and control flow
   - Functions and modules
   - Object-oriented programming
   - NumPy for numerical computing

2. **Linux Fundamentals**
   - Command line basics
   - File system navigation
   - Package management
   - Shell scripting

3. **Mathematics for Robotics**
   - Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, transformations)
   - Calculus (derivatives, integrals)
   - Probability and statistics basics

4. **Physics Basics**
   - Kinematics
   - Dynamics
   - Forces and motion

## Time Estimate

**Expected completion time**: 40-60 hours

## Next Steps

Once you complete this stage and pass the assessment, you'll unlock **Stage 2: ROS 2 & Simulation**, where you'll start working with real robotics software and simulation environments.
