# Stage 3: Perception & Planning

<div className="stage-badge stage-3">Stage 3</div>

In Stage 3, you'll add perception capabilities to your robots and implement intelligent planning algorithms.

## Learning Objectives

<div className="learning-objectives">

By the end of this stage, you will be able to:

- Process and interpret camera and LIDAR data
- Implement object detection and recognition
- Design and execute motion planning algorithms
- Integrate perception with control systems

</div>

## Prerequisites

<div className="prerequisites">

**You must complete Stage 2 before starting this stage.**

Required knowledge:
- ROS 2 fundamentals
- Robot simulation experience
- Python and C++ programming

</div>

## Topics Covered

1. **Computer Vision**
   - Image processing with OpenCV
   - Object detection (YOLO, SSD)
   - 3D vision and point clouds

2. **LIDAR Processing**
   - Point cloud filtering
   - Obstacle detection
   - Environment mapping

3. **Motion Planning**
   - Path planning algorithms (A*, RRT)
   - Trajectory optimization
   - Dynamic obstacle avoidance

4. **Sensor Fusion**
