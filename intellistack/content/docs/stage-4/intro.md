# Stage 4: AI Integration

<div className="stage-badge stage-4">Stage 4</div>

Stage 4 brings AI and machine learning into your robotics projects, enabling intelligent behavior and adaptation.

## Learning Objectives

<div className="learning-objectives">

By the end of this stage, you will be able to:

- Train and deploy machine learning models for robotics
- Implement reinforcement learning for robot control
- Transfer skills from simulation to real robots (sim-to-real)
- Build end-to-end learning systems

</div>

## Prerequisites

<div className="prerequisites">

**You must complete Stage 3 before starting this stage.**

Required knowledge:
- Perception systems
- Motion planning
- Python and PyTorch/TensorFlow

</div>

## Topics Covered

1. **Machine Learning for Robotics**
   - Supervised learning for perception
   - Model training and evaluation
   - Deployment strategies

2. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Q-learning and DQN
   - Policy gradient methods
   - Training in simulation

3. **Sim-to-Real Transfer**
   - Domain randomization
   - Reality gap mitigation
   - Transfer learning techniques

4. **End-to-End Learning**
   - Imitation learning
   - Learning from demonstration
   - Behavioral cloning

## Time Estimate

**Expected completion time**: 70-90 hours

## Safety Checkpoint

Before deploying any code to real hardware, you must complete the **10-item safety assessment** that ensures you understand safe robotics practices.

## Next Steps

After Stage 4, you'll begin your **Stage 5: Capstone Project**, where you'll build a complete robotics system.
