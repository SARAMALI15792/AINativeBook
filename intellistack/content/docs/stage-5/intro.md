# Stage 5: Capstone Project

<div className="stage-badge stage-5">Stage 5</div>

Welcome to the final stage! You'll apply everything you've learned to build a complete robotics system from scratch.

## Learning Objectives

<div className="learning-objectives">

By the end of this stage, you will be able to:

- Design and implement a complete robotics system
- Integrate perception, planning, and control
- Demonstrate professional development practices
- Present and document your work effectively

</div>

## Prerequisites

<div className="prerequisites">

**You must complete Stages 1-4 before starting the capstone.**

Required:
- All previous stage badges
- Safety assessment passed
