   - At least 3 ROS 2 nodes communicating
   - Error handling and recovery

2. **AI/ML Component** (25%)
   - At least one trained model
   - Demonstrated learning capability
   - Performance metrics documented

3. **Simulation** (20%)
   - Fully functional in Gazebo or Isaac Sim
   - Repeatable demonstrations
   - Edge case testing

4. **Documentation** (15%)
   - Architecture diagram
   - Setup instructions
   - Code documentation

5. **Safety** (10%)
   - Safety analysis completed
   - Emergency stop implemented
   - Risk mitigation documented

## Project Ideas

### Beginner Level
