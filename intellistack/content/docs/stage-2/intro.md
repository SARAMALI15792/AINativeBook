# Stage 2: ROS 2 & Simulation

<div className="stage-badge stage-2">Stage 2</div>

Welcome to Stage 2! Now that you have strong foundations, you'll learn to work with ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) and simulation environments.

## Learning Objectives

<div className="learning-objectives">

By the end of this stage, you will be able to:

- Set up and configure ROS 2 development environments
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Work with Gazebo simulation environment
- Navigate robots in simulated environments
- Use URDF/XACRO for robot modeling

</div>

## Prerequisites

<div className="prerequisites">

**You must complete Stage 1 before starting this stage.**

Required knowledge:
- Python programming
- Linux command line proficiency
- Basic mathematics and physics

</div>

## Topics Covered

1. **ROS 2 Basics**
   - ROS 2 architecture and concepts
   - Nodes and communication patterns
   - Launch files and parameters

2. **Gazebo Simulation**
   - Setting up Gazebo Harmonic
   - Creating simulation worlds
   - Sensor integration

3. **Robot Navigation**
   - SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
   - Path planning algorithms
   - Obstacle avoidance

4. **Robot Modeling**
   - URDF/XACRO syntax
   - Creating custom robot models
   - Physical properties and collision geometries

## Time Estimate

**Expected completion time**: 50-70 hours

## Simulation Environment

All exercises in this stage use **Gazebo simulation**. You don't need physical hardware. The platform provides cloud-based simulation instances with a 25 hrs/month quota.

## Next Steps

After mastering Stage 2, you'll move to **Stage 3: Perception & Planning**, where you'll add sensors and intelligent decision-making to your robots.
